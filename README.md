# Otterss

Hi! I made Otterss to test and explore mainly Android's Jetpack Compose UI, but also other Jetpack libraries. 

It is just an RSS reader app without an actual reading view, just displays a list feed subscriptions and allows you to enter a url of a feed to subscribe to it. It uses [KtRssReader library](https://github.com/ivanisidrowu/KtRssReader?utm_source=android-arsenal.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=8178) to handle fetching of feeds. Feel free to test the app.
